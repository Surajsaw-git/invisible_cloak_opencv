# invisible_cloak_opencv
This repository implements a real-time "Invisibility Cloak" effect using OpenCV and Python. By capturing a background frame and using HSV color segmentation, it identifies a specific colored cloth and replaces it with the background. It utilizes morphological transformations and bitwise operations to create a seamless magical effect.
